# Project Description

The project was conducted as part of the _Machine Learning_ course, aiming to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical example.

The group task focused on data preprocessing. The dataset that was used had numerous missing and incorrect values, as well as significant differences in the ranges of individual columns. The goal of the group task was to conduct exploratory data analysis.

The individual task pertains to selecting a method for building a classification model. During the completion of this task, model evaluation was conducted, as well as potential improvements. Undersampling and oversampling were performed, along with parameter tuning.
